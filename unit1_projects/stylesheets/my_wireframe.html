		<h1>Planning my Index.html</h2>
		<h3>Main functions of my GitHub page:</h3>
		<li>Landing page for my GitHub</li>
		<li>Making first impression</li>
		<li>For user to be able to navigate to other pages</li>
		<li>Introduce what this site is about</li>

		<h3>Theme</h3>

		<figcaption>So I went looking for a cool blog design/theme and found this one to be very simple yet at the same time very elegant. So I decided to use this theme.</figcaption>
		<p>However, the final outlook would not look like this for couple of reasons as you will see in the wireframe.</p>
	
		<h3>Wireframe</h3>
		<img src="images/wf.png">
		<li>The top main menu will not be able to hold all of my pages. So I want a list instead on side of the page.</li>
		<li>The articles are seperate from the index.html so there will only be a linkable image preview of them.</li>
