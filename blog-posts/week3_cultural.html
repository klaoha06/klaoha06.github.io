					So according the Gregorc Thinking Style test, I am a Concrete Sequential Thinkers who tend to be based in reality. I process information in an ordered, sequential, linear way. However, as I work and work on different assignments I found myself more and more like Concrete Random person who is experimenter. I like to experiment on different code to see if it works. Form a quick theory of what the solution could be and try out different possible solutions there and then before heading over to Google. And in these experiments, I am learning a lot through trial and error. So I would say that through my actions, I am a Concrete random person.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, that I know my thinking style. I feel that the best environment for me to learn regardless of where I would be is to allow me to explore. Since experimentation is my name of the game, letting me explore on unknown territory would demand me to do a lot of experimentation. And I will quickly learn from such endeavor.
				</p>
				<p>
					One major problem that I could see from being a Concrete Random person is the fact that sometimes I do more experimenting than learning. What I mean by this is that sometimes when I write my code and I would experiment by putting out different answers. And when it works and I thought "Oh yeah, it works now.", and then move on without trying to understand why it did and why it didn't work. So that is one major issue I notice being a Concrete Random person whose goal is to do experiment.
				</p>
				<p>
					I personally feel that experimentation without review could be problematic in the long-run. So I think my strategies to dealing with my issue is to develop a habit. So right after I finished my experimentation, or found an solution for my code instead of moving on to the next experimentation I should conciously remind myself to go back and understanding why thing works and why it doesn't right after each mini-successful experimentation during my coding.
				</p>
				<p>
					To conclude, I feel that the thinking test help you to somewhat identify your thinking style. However, I feel it is not enough. The best why to know your thinking style is to be mindful of how you work. And mindfulness will not only help you identify your working issue, but it will also help remind you from making the same mistake. You can't fix what you can't see. So know thy self!
