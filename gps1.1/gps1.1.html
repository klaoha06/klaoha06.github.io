    <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
    <p>According to Wikipedia, ..</p>
    <p>"Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which 
    two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes 
    code while the other, the observer, pointer or navigator,[1] reviews each 
    line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently
    ."</p>
    <p>In our opinion, Pair Programming is a method of development by which 
    two or more persons work together on a coding project simultaneously. 
    Typically one person will be driving while the other 
    people will be navigating.</p>
    <h3>Driver and Navigator</h3>
    <p>Simply put, driver is the person who is currently editing the project
    while the navigator help steer the driver as well as the work into the 
    right direction.</p>

    <h3>Benefits of Pair Programming</h3>
    <h4>Fewer Mistakes</h4>
    <p>If we work alone we can easily miss and overlook simple things. However,
        when we have someone working together he or she can point out the 
        mistakes that we might overlooked.
    </p>
    <h4>Efficiency</h4>
    <p>While writing code in pair programming, you have two people who actively
    understand the thought process and logic behind the code. This reduced the
    time for bringing on someone to QA your code, as it is happening 
    simultaneously. The quality of code after a pair programming project will be
    higher and there are two people who can bounce ideas off of each other to 
    alleviate any gaps in knowledge. 
    </p>
    <h4>Better Learning</h4>
    <p>When pairng with people who are of different experience levels, it can 
    be a great opportunity to quickly even the experience playing field. If
    first learning coding it is highly beneficial to have a navigator alongside 
    to answer questions and point out any mistakes that you may have encountered.
    </p>
    <p>Another benefit that comes with Pair Programming is that you get to learn
    all the little tricks and technique which your pair has been using.</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>While pairing we were able to get a basic wireframe, content, structure,
        and design for this website in a relatively short amount of time. Having
            a second person to fill in any gaps in knowledge, point out any mistakes,
            or provide any advices is beneficial to quickly creating a web page.
